Normal TCP three-way handshake:
 
During a normal TCP communication, the following steps occur;
 
The client hosts sends a SYN / Synchronize to initiate the connection request.
The server responds / acknowledges the original SYN request by sending SYN-ACK back to the client.
The client sends the ACK as a response back to the server, after which the connection is established.
 
This type of communication is known as TCP Three-way handshake. The Diagram below explains the TCP three-way handshake process.

TCP SYN Flood:
 
An attacker client sends the TCP SYN connections at a high rate to the victim machine, more than what the victim can process. This is a form of resource exhausting denial of service attack. The attacker client can do the effective SYN attack using two methods.
 
The malicious client which performs the SYN attack will keep sending the SYN packets which are usually of 64 byteAnd when the victim server sends the SYN-ACK messages as an acknowledgement the malicious clien the malicious attacker client does not send the ACK message. The client just ignores the SYN-ACK message and keeps sending the new SYN messages.
As an alternative, the malicious client can forge / spoof the source IP address and sends the SYN packets to the victim server. The Victim server sends the SYN-ACK to the spoofed source address and waits for the ACK response. Since the spoofed sources did not originally send t
