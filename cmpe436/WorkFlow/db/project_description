I will create a reporting app for a project team. In my app, members of the project will report what they did every day. 
- Each team member will be able to edit only today's report (not past).
- Each team member will be able read all reports from the beginning of the project.
- While a member writing or editing his report for the first time in 5 r today, other members cannot writing or editing. This means two or more members cannot writing or editing at the same time.

I am going to use Android on the client side and use JSP(Java Server Page) on the server side.
